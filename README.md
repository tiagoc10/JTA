Improvements:
- Include more diverse and detailed textual descriptions from the datasets to improve the quality of responses, while avoiding redundancy.
- Enable conversational memory so the chatbot can remember previous user interactions and maintain context throughout the conversation.
- Build a simple web to make interaction more user friendly.
- Enable uploading XLSX or JSON files to the chatbot, so it can update its knowledge based on those files.

Limitations:
- No chat memory available.
- Evaluate different approaches to building the chatbot.
