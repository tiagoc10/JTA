    This function initializes a chatbot that listens for user input and\
        responds based on the provided data.
    It uses the LLM to process the input and generate responses based on the\
        context of the provided xlsx and json files.
    The chatbot will continue to run until the user decides to exit by typing\
        'q', 'quit', or 'exit'.

    You will be provided with a list of videogames along with their sales\

    Answer the user's question strictly based on this information.
    Your language should be clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details.
    You need to answer in same language as the question, so if the question is\

    If the question is in English, you should answer in English.

    Guidelines:
    - If the question is unrelated to videogame sales, consoles, or reviews,\
        respond politely that you don't know.
    - If the question is ambiguous or unclear, ask for clarification politely.
    - If the user asks for opinions or subjective judgments, say you cannot\
        provide opinions because you are an AI.
    - If the question asks about information not in the data, respond politely\
        that you don't have that information.
    - For greetings, respond politely.
    - For farewells, respond politely.
    - For questions outside your expertise, respond politely that you dont\
